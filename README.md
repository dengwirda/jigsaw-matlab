`JIGSAW` is an unstructured mesh generator and tessellation library; designed to generate high-quality triangulations and polyhedral decompositions of general planar, surface and volumetric domains. `JIGSAW` includes refinement-based algorithms for the construction of new meshes, optimisation-driven techniques for the improvement of existing grids, as well as routines to assemble (restricted) Delaunay tessellations, Voronoi complexes and Power diagrams.

This package provides a <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">`MATLAB`</a> / <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave">`OCTAVE`</a> based scripting interface to the underlying `JIGSAW` mesh generator, including a range of additional facilities for file I/O, mesh visualisation and post-processing operations.

`JIGSAW` has been compiled and tested on various `64-bit` `Linux` , `Windows` and `Mac` based platforms. 

### `Quickstart`

    Ensure you have a c++ compiler and the cmake utility installed.
    Clone/download + unpack this repository.
    From MATLAB / OCTAVE:
    Run compile.m
    Run example.m
    
Note: installation of `JIGSAW` requires a `c++` compiler and the `cmake` utility. `JIGSAW` may also be installed as a `conda` package. See <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw">here</a> for details.
